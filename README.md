# NCNews App

## What is NCNews App?
NC News App is a mobile-first app developed within a week using Vite+React. It allows the user to perform the following actions:
- Access a variety of articles from the database.
- Use filter, sort_by and order functions to retrieve the desired articles from the database.
- Access unique articles and vote/comment on them. 
- Delete their own comments from articles.
